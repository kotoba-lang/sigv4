  Signing and verifying are the same computation run from opposite ends, so they
  share `sigv4.core` rather than each carrying their own canonicalization. That
  matters more than it sounds: when the two drift, a gateway accepts requests a
  client cannot produce, or rejects ones it can, and the symptom is an opaque
  403 either way.

  Pure except for the digest and HMAC, which arrive through `ICrypto` exactly as
  on the signing side."
