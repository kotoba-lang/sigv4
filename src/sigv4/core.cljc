  "AWS Signature Version 4 — the **pure** half, shared across this workspace.

  Every function here is a total function from data to data: no clock, no
  randomness, no network, no crypto primitives, no host interop beyond UTF-8
  byte extraction. That is deliberate. SigV4 is famously easy to get wrong in
  the *string* layer (encoding rules, sort order, trailing newlines), and that
  layer is exactly the part that can be pinned by the published AWS reference
  vectors — see `test/sigv4/core_test.cljc`, which asserts the documented
  canonical-request / string-to-sign / signature values byte for byte.

  The two impure ingredients SigV4 needs — SHA-256 and HMAC-SHA-256 — are NOT
  here. The host supplies them (`sigv4.crypto`, or its own `ICrypto`), because
  their shape differs per runtime: `javax.crypto` is synchronous on the JVM
  while `crypto.subtle` returns Promises in a browser or Worker. Keeping them
  out means this namespace is identical on every runtime in the kotoba-lang
  ladder, and testable without a crypto provider.

  `signing-key-chain` is the seam: it returns the *ordered HMAC inputs* for the
  key-derivation ladder, so the host folds its own HMAC over them — sync or
  async, its choice — without this namespace ever touching a cipher.

;; ── RFC 3986 percent-encoding ────────────────────────────────────────────────
;;
;; S3 requires strict RFC 3986 encoding with uppercase hex, and unlike
;; `encodeURIComponent` it does NOT exempt ! ' ( ) *. Rather than call
;; `encodeURIComponent` and patch the exceptions back (the usual JS recipe, and
;; a recurring source of signature mismatches), encode from UTF-8 bytes
;; directly — one implementation, identical output on every runtime.
;;
;; Encoding from bytes rather than characters also fixes a real defect in the
;; implementations this library replaces: a `charCodeAt`-based encoder emits
;; UTF-16 code units, so any non-ASCII key or query value signs differently
;; from what AWS and every S3 SDK compute. `kotoba/pct_encode.kotoba` is a
;; second, independent implementation of this exact function, held to
;; byte-equality with it over all 256 byte values.
