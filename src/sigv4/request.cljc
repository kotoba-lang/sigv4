  "Sign one S3-compatible request: config in, `{:url :headers}` out.

  `sigv4.core` is the string layer; this is the composition over it — payload
  hash, header set, canonical request, key ladder, `Authorization`. Every
  consumer in this workspace had written that composition itself, which is the
  larger half of what was duplicated: sharing only the string layer would have
  left the same twenty lines of orchestration in nine places, each free to get
  the header set or the payload hash subtly wrong.

  Endpoint-agnostic. Backblaze B2, Cloudflare R2, Storj Gateway-MT and Amazon
  S3 all speak the same protocol here; which endpoint is legitimate is the
  caller's policy, not this namespace's."

  `:now` is an ISO-8601 instant the caller supplies — the library reads no
  clock, which is what makes a signature reproducible and therefore testable.
  `:payload-hash` defaults to the SHA-256 of `:body`, or the empty-string hash
  when there is no body; pass `sigv4.core/unsigned-payload` for a streaming
  body. `:headers` are merged in and signed, so anything you put there
  (`content-type`, `range`) is covered by the signature. `:service` defaults to
  `s3`."
