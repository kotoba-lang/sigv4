  `sigv4.core` is the string layer; this is the composition over it — payload
  hash, header set, canonical request, key ladder, `Authorization`. Every
  consumer in this workspace had written that composition itself, which is the
  larger half of what was duplicated: sharing only the string layer would have
  left the same twenty lines of orchestration in nine places, each free to get
  the header set or the payload hash subtly wrong.

  S3 all speak the same protocol here; which endpoint is legitimate is the
  caller's policy, not this namespace's."

  Anything in `:headers` is signed TOO, and that is the difference between a
  URL and a capability with a shape:

  store any number of bytes under a key whose content they never had to know.

  the constraint has to be in the signature, and the returned `:headers` are
  exactly what the client has to send back for that signature to verify.
