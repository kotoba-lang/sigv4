  "The Kotoba percent-encoder held to the Clojure one, as a suite a gate can
  read.

  `kotoba/pct_encode.kotoba` reimplements `sigv4.core/uri-encode` in Kotoba and
  is compiled to WebAssembly by the released CLI. Two implementations of one
  function are only worth having if something makes them agree, and \"it
  compiled\" is not agreement -- so this feeds both the same bytes and requires
  byte-identical output across every ASCII code point, multi-byte UTF-8, and
  realistic S3 keys.

  This was `scripts/verify-kotoba.cljs`, which printed `ok <label>` lines. The
  shared fleet gate parses a clojure.test summary and refuses to report a pass
  without one, so being gated meant speaking that format.

  ## It builds the module rather than assuming one

  The `.wasm` is a build artifact and is not committed, so a suite that only
  read it would pass or fail on whether someone happened to have built it. It
  invokes the CLI, and **fails loudly when the CLI is absent** -- a skipped
  parity check must not report the same thing as a satisfied one.

  That is not hypothetical here. Measured 2026-08-17: `kotoba wasm emit` had
  been failing `check-failed` since the language grew its T1 memory-safety
  gate, so this comparison could not run at all, and nothing said so because
  nothing ran it.
